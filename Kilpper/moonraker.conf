address: 192.168.4.47

# The type of device. Can be either gpio, klipper_device, rf,
# tplink_smartplug, tasmota, shelly, homeseer, homeassistant, loxonev1,
# smartthings, mqtt or hue.
# This parameter must be provided.
off_when_shutdown: True
# If set to True the device will be powered off when Klipper enters
# the "shutdown" state. This option applies to all device types.
# The default is False.
off_when_shutdown_delay: 0
# If "off_when_shutdown" is set, this option specifies the amount of time
# (in seconds) to wait before turning the device off. Default is 0 seconds.
on_when_job_queued: True
# If set to True the device will power on if a job is queued while the
# device is off. This allows for an automated "upload, power on, and
# print" approach directly from the slicer, see the configuration example
# below for details. The default is False.
locked_while_printing: True
# If True, locks the device so that the power cannot be changed while the
# printer is printing. This is useful to avert an accidental shutdown to
# the printer's power. The default is False.
restart_klipper_when_powered: True
# If set to True, Moonraker will schedule a "FIRMWARE_RESTART" to command
# after the device has been powered on. If it isn't possible to immediately
# schedule a firmware restart (ie: Klippy is disconnected), the restart
# will be postponed until Klippy reconnects and reports that startup is
# complete. Prior to scheduling the restart command the power device will
# always check Klippy's state. If Klippy reports that it is "ready", the
# FIRMWARE_RESTART will be aborted as unnecessary.
# The default is False.
restart_delay: 5
# If "restart_klipper_when_powered" is set, this option specifies the amount
# of time (in seconds) to delay the restart. Default is 1 second.
bound_services:
# A newline separated list of services that are "bound" to the state of this
# device. When the device is powered on all bound services will be started.
# When the device is powered off all bound services are stopped.
#
# The items in this list are limited to those specified in the allow list,
# see the [machine] configuration documentation for details. Additionally,
# the Moonraker service can not be bound to a power device. Note that
# service names are case sensitive.
#
# The default is no services are bound to the device.
